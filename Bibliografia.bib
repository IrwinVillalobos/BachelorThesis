	abstract = {This volume presents answers to some natural questions of a general analytic character that arise in the theory of Banach spaces. I believe that altogether too many of the results presented herein are unknown to the active abstract analysts, and this is not as it should be. Banach space theory has much to offer the prac- titioners of analysis; unfortunately, some of the general principles that motivate the theory and make accessible many of its stunning achievements are couched in the technical jargon of the area, thereby making it unapproachable to one unwilling to spend considerable time and effort in deciphering the jargon. With this in mind, I have concentrated on presenting what I believe are basic phenomena in Banach spaces that any analyst can appreciate, enjoy, and perhaps even use. The topics covered have at least one serious omission: the beautiful and powerful theory of type and cotype. To be quite frank, I could not say what I wanted to say about this subject without increasing the length of the text by at least 75 percent. Even then, the words would not have done as much good as the advice to seek out the rich Seminaire Maurey-Schwartz lecture notes, wherein the theory's development can be traced from its conception. Again, the treasured volumes of Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri also present much of the theory of type and cotype and are must reading for those really interested in Banach space theory.},

	isbn = {978-0-387-98431-5},
	abstract = {Many important reference works in Banach space theory have appeared since Banach's "Th{\'e}orie des Op{\'e}rations Lin{\'e}aires", the impetus for the development of much of the modern theory in this field. While these works are classical starting points for the graduate student wishing to do research in Banach space theory, they can be formidable reading for the student who has just completed a course in measure theory and integration that introduces the L\_p spaces and would like to know more about Banach spaces in general. The purpose of this book is to bridge this gap and provide an introduction to the basic theory of Banach spaces and functional analysis. It prepares students for further study of both the classical works and current research. It is accessible to students who understand the basic properties of L\_p spaces but have not had a course in functional analysis. The book is sprinkled liberally with examples, historical notes, and references to original sources. Over 450 exercises provide supplementary examples and counterexamples and give students practice in the use of the results developed in the text.},

It will be particularly useful for research investigation of nonlinear functional analysis and optimization{\textellipsis}This book will stand as an important working text and reference and a significant guide for research students." (Mathematical Reviews) "This book can be warmly recommended to everyone interested in functional analysis, and Banach space theory in particular. It serves also as a textbook in courses for students in probability, physics, or engineering. Graduate students and researchers surely will find a lot of material from the field, as well as a source of inspiration." (European Mathematical Society Newsletter, September, 2003) "This is a substantial text containing an up-to-date exposition of functional analysis {\textellipsis} . It will be particularly useful for research investigation of nonlinear functional analysis and optimization. {\textellipsis} Each chapter ends with a remarkably weighty collection of exercises, many of which have useful hints at solutions appended to them {\textellipsis} . the reader is directed throughout to the ample collection of references. The book will stand as an important working text and reference and a significant guide for research students." (John R. Giles, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2002 f) "The sextet of authors have done a superb job in marshalling and presenting their material: the writing is crisp and authoritative and they take full advantage of recent simplifications in the proofs of certain results. The fulsome, up-to-date bibliography is accompanied by a marvellous collection of nearly 700 exercises (with integrated hints): for both learners and lecturers, this rich source of material alone is worth more than the cost of the book. {\textellipsis} I warmly commend this book {\textellipsis} ." (Nick Lord, The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 87 (509), 2003) "This book, which contains a vast amount of material, is intended as an introduction to linear function analysis {\textellipsis} . At the end of each chapter there is a wealth of beautiful applications and exercises {\textellipsis} . I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the study of Banach spaces {\textellipsis} . I think it would be fair to say that if one knew half of the material contained in this book, then one would know quite a lot." (Warren Moors, The Australian Mathematical Society Gazette, Vol. 29 (5), 2002) "This book is based on graduate courses taught at the university of Alberta in Edmonton. It is intended as an introduction to linear functional analysis and to some parts of infinite-dimensional Banach space theory. It is full of facts, theorems, corollaries; along with a large number of exercises with detailed hints for their solution. {\textellipsis} The authors have accomplished a text which is easily readable and as self-contained as possible. A very excellent book for the topics covered." (Joe Howard, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 981, 2002) "By its organization, the book can be used as a textbook for various types of courses in functional analysis {\textellipsis} . Besides classical material, the book contains also some recent and more specialized results {\textellipsis} . The book contains a large number of exercises with detailed hints, completing the main text with many important results. The book is a valuable contribution to Banach space literature and can be used as a solid introduction to functional analysis {\textellipsis} ." (Stefan Cobzas, Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai Mathematica, Vol. XLVII (2), 2002) "The present book is {\textellipsis} intended as an introduction to linear functional analysis {\textellipsis} . Each chapter concludes with a separate section in which together nearly 700 exercises are listed. Almost all of them, as it seems, are supplemented with hints to their solution. The exercises are an important part of the general text, contain many important results and essentially complement the material in the chapters. {\textellipsis} Altogether, the material presented is simply enormous and could fill with enthusiasm {\textellipsis} ."

It also considers different approaches to the Banach{\textendash}Stone theorem as well as variations of the theorem.  The book covers locally convex spaces; barreled, bornological, and webbed spaces; and reflexivity.

The usual topics of point-set topology, including metric spaces, general topological spaces, continuity, topological equivalence, basis, sub-basis, connectedness , compactness, separation properties, metrization, subspaces, product spaces, and quotient spaces are treated in this text. Most of the factual information about topology presented in this text is stated in the theorems and illustrated in the accompanying examples, figures and exercises. This book contains many exercises of varying degrees of difficulty. The notation used in this text is reasonably standard; a list of symbols with definitions appears on the front end-sheets. This text is designed for a one-semester introduction to topology at the undergraduate and beginning graduate levels.
